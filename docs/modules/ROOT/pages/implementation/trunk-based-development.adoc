= Trunk Based Development
:author: Harmen Weber
:email: harmen.weber@gmail.com

This repository follows the https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/[trunk based development] approach.
In general:

* Every feature and fix gets its own new branch of the main branch.
* Branches get rebased frequently.
* Branches have a short lifespan.

The goal is to ensure minimal divergence between development streams and to avoid large and error-prone merge actions.

Branches get merged back into the main branch using fast-forward merges.
Fast-forward merges:

* ensure a clean, linear and understandable history of the repository
* remove the risk of introducing a bug due to an incorrect merge

[IMPORTANT]
====
To ensure fast-forward merges only, execute the following command in the root of the repository:

[source,shell]
----
git config merge.ff only

== Steps to merge a branch back into the main branch

Before the merge:

1. Rebase the branch.
2. Ensure the branch builds successfully.

When merging:

* Squash the commits on the branch into a single commit with a commit message that adheres to the https://www.conventionalcommits.org[conventional commits].
