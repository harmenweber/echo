Below are the user journeys / domain stories that drive the development of Echo.

== Capturing HTTP requests

As a software engineer that needs to integrate some data provider, I want to capture the provider's data even before I start the integration so that I can review and better understand the data.

Let's say you have to integrate a data provider.
Eventually, the data provider will push data to one of your endpoints.
However, your endpoint isn't ready yet, since you haven't started the integration yet.
You read the data provider's specification.
Syntactically, you know what to expect - assuming the spec was still up-to-date.
Unfortunately, the spec focuses mostly on syntax and hardly on semantics.
So, you ask some questions.
But even after you got your answers, there might still be surprises.
For example, the data might get pushed in an unexpected order.
Or, some optional fields might be empty in cases you expected them to be present.
Or vice versa.

To avoid such surprises, it would be helpful if you saw some real data, even before you started the integration.
Echo can help you with that as follows:

1. You, a software engineer, want to integrate a data provider.
2. You can create en Echo endpoint that captures data in seconds.
3. You share the Echo endpoint info with the data provider.
4. The data provider starts pushing data to your Echo endpoint.
5. You analyse the data captured by the Echo endpoint using Echo's API or UI.

[NOTE]
====
You might find yourself also in the role of the data provider.
A software engineer wants to integrate your service.
She/He doesn't have an endpoint ready yet.
Nevertheless, she/he would like to see already some real data.
It would correct her/his expectations and speed up the integration.

Tell her/him to create an Echo data capturing endpoint.
Tell her/him to share the endpoint info with you.
Start pushing data to that endpoint so she/he can see some real data.
