= Monorepo

This repository is a monorepo for the Echo project.
The repository will contain all applications, libraries and documentation related to the Echo project.

The reasons why I choose a monorepo are the following:

* Reuse existing project and CI setup.
* No need to publish versioned packages since all consumers are in the same repository.
* Everything works together at every commit.
There's no such thing as a breaking change when you fix everything in the same commit.

As monorepo tool, I picked https://nx.dev[Nx] by Nrwl.
I chose the Nx plugin _@jnxplus/nx-boot-maven_ to add Spring Boot and Maven multi-module project support.
The applications and libraries that get generated look ok, I only have to change a few minor things to support xref:implementation/semantic-versioning.adoc[] the way I want.
